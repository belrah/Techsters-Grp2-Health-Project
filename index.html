                <h3>Training On Bio Gas Production And Usage</h3><p>One of the most effective and efficient ways of stopping climate change is through people changing from using fossil fuel to using clean energy. That is why BG-Tech Energy partners with competent and reliable organizations who are experts in Bio Gas production to train interested people on using waste to generate Bio Gas Energy. Our plan is to train 100 young Africans and farmers who need energy for either domestic or industrial usage in the first year of operation</p><input type="button" value="Register Here">

            <div class="col text-container"><h3>Converting Waste To Wealth</h3><p>The waste management system in Nigeria right now is very poor and it does not only deface the country but also poses a threat to public healthBy promoting the use of Bio Gas and training people on harnessing Bio Gas energy, waste would be taken as valuable assets and therefore not be disposed inappropriately. This would make for clean environments, thereby improving public health.</p></div>

                <h3>Fighting Against Climate Change</h3><p>By using the power of technology, we spread the message of climate change to people through educating them about its facts, effects and how we can all be part of the solution.We also bring the solution closer to them by providing them with climate change action groups nearest to them that they can be part of.</p>
