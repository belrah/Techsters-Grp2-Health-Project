              <p class="card-text service-container">One of the most effective and efficient ways of stopping climate change is through people changing from using fossil fuel to using clean energy. That is why BG-Tech Energy partners with competent and reliable organizations who are experts in Bio Gas production to train interested people on using waste to generate Bio Gas Energy. Our plan is to train 100 young Africans and farmers who need energy for either domestic or industrial usage in the first year of operation</p>

              <p class="card-text service-container">The waste management system in Nigeria right now is very poor and it does not only deface the country but also poses a threat to public healthBy promoting the use of Bio Gas and training people on harnessing Bio Gas energy, waste would be taken as valuable assets and therefore not be disposed inappropriately. This would make for clean environments, thereby improving public health. This is even more important during this pandemic as cleanliness is a big deal to all humans.</p>

This would also serve as a form of empowerment and enlightenment on making better choices so as to save our planet. People would also be saved the cost of buying fossil fuels and can divert that money into something more pressing.</p>
